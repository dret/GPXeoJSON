GPXeoJSON Examples
==================

These are some example files for testing the GPXeoJSON converter. Usually, there should be two files with the same name, one being GPX (the GPX input), and the other being JSON (the GeoJSON output).

If you want to test and visualize the GeoJSON files, [GeoJSONLint](http://geojsonlint.com/) is an excellent tool where you can simply copy/paste the GeoJSON, and see it rendered on a map.
